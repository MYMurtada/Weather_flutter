# Weather_flutter

Hello and welcome to this repository.

in the begging let me introduce the app for you.
The app is an API that gets the weather data from openweathermap.org.

This page will contain the main components of the app such as the temperature and the city name.


Reset to the current location button (Top left):

When this button is clicked the app will automatically get the user's current location and weather data.


Searching by city name page (Top Right):

This page should let the user search for any city they want and automatically get the weather data and display it in the MAIN PAGE.

In the end, this app is just a training on the flutter API system and getting used to it, if you needed any help text me on Twitter: SWE_Mohammad.
